# Project Title: Analyzing Personal Expenses 
## Overview
This project aims to simulate an expense tracker for an individual using the Faker library. The project generates realistic monthly expense data, processes and stores it in a SQL database, and creates SQL queries to derive insights into spending behavior. A Streamlit app is developed to visualize these insights and showcase the results of SQL queries. The tracker will highlight expenses across categories like bills, groceries, subscriptions, and personal spending, providing a comprehensive overview of financial habits over a year.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** (Core Logic & Data Processing)
- **Streamlit** (Dashboard & User Interface)
- **MySQL** (Database for storing expenses)
- **Plotly** (Interactive Data Visualizations)
- **Faker** (Synthetic Expense Data Generation)
  
## Domain
The project operates within the **Financial Management** domain, focusing on **expense tracking and analysis**.

## Approach
1. **Set up a Streamlit App** – Develop an interactive UI to input and visualize expenses.
2. **Connect to MySQL Database** – Store and manage user expense data securely.
3. **Generate Synthetic Data with Faker** – Create sample expense data for testing and analysis.
4. **Execute SQL Queries** – Fetch insights on spending trends and generate financial reports.
5. **Data Visualization** – Use **Plotly** to present expenses in graphical formats.

## Libraries Used
- **Streamlit** (User Interface)
- **MySQL Connector** (Database Connection)
- **Faker** (Synthetic Data Generation)
- **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)
- **Plotly** (Data Visualization)
