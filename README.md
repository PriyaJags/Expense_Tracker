Problem Statement:
This project aims to simulate an expense tracker for an individual using the Faker library. The project generates realistic monthly expense data, processes and stores it in a SQL database, and creates SQL queries to derive insights into spending behavior. A Streamlit app is developed to visualize these insights and showcase the results of SQL queries. The tracker will highlight expenses across categories like bills, groceries, subscriptions, and personal spending, providing a comprehensive overview of financial habits over a year.

Features

 Data Visualization: Interactive charts to analyze expenses over time.

  SQL Query Execution: Predefined SQL queries to generate instant insights.

 Expense Categorization: Categorizes transactions for better budgeting.

 Cashback & Spending Trends: Helps identify spending patterns and cashback earnings.

 MySQL Database Integration: Secure and scalable storage for expense data.

 Faker Library Support: Generates synthetic data for testing and analysis.
